It is a cross-platform application to bring consumers and producers from the cooking industry to a single place that is made using the MERN stack for the web and React Native for the android app. It has been divided into 2 parts - an app for cooks where they can accept requests from customers and the other one for the customers who can hire cooks as per their requirements. Some other features include a payment portal, live tracking of cooks, and a special admin portal.
